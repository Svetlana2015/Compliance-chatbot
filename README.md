# Compliance-chatbot
This project aims to meet the compliance needs of companies in the pharmaceutical sector.

This is a tool that should capture and make available the knowledge of a domain expert to allow them to save time and focus on high value-added tasks.

The objective is to offer users instant access to verified information specific to their internal issues, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

It includes a structured knowledge base (questions/answers/aliases) and natural language processing features (sentence transformer).

Database hosted on S3 (data is now fictitious although realistic, real data being confidential):
* Centralized management of questions/answers and associated aliases to cover a wide range of compliance issues.
* Manual update of data to integrate new questions.
